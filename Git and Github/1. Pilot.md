#### States
1. Unstaged changes
2. Staged changes (after git add .)
3. Commit changes (after git commit)
4. Push changes (after git push)


### Levels of branching
1. Main
2. Testing
3. Dev


###  How to create branches

List of all branch - `git branch`
create new branch - `git branch newBranch`

switch to already existing branch = `git checkout newBranch`
create a new branch and switch to new branch - `git checkout -b newBranch`



- create a new Folder

After git init
.git is created 

it has config, Fetch_head, HEAD

then `git remote add <name> <url>`

### origin is name of the url

input 'git remote'  output gives origin

### What is upstream branch
local to origin (remote) is upstream
`git push --set-upstream origin master`



### How to clone
copy with ssh
or clone with url   `git clone <url>`


### How to see older commits
`git log`
output - `commit id (branch) author date`



## Format of branch
`jira-id/branch/featureName`

## Use tab to complete cmd line 

### Update git branches
`git fetch`
`git status`

### Steps to follow contribute to same repo

- Lead will create a repo. Initially repo will have main, testing, dev branches
- Member will fork the repo and clone it his local system
- `git remote add upstream https://github.com/GSAshish/RecipeApp.git`
- `git fetch upstream`

```js
PS C:\Users\kumar.manglam.TL164\Documents\Tech\LearnGit\RecipeApp> git remote
origin
upstream
```

upstream -- Lead
`git fetch`load changes of upstream to my local
`git pull`

### hvjhvjh


forking -- member
`git fetch --all`
`git merge upstream/dev`


to update the origin
`git push origin branch_name`



Person who forked a branch
git stash `to remove current changes`
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/dev




### How to copy same changes into different branch

dev - feature2

dev2 - feature2-dev2

`git cherry-pick hashcode`


## How to merge - merge conflicts
`git merge dev2`

- git stash
- git pop




git merge --abort
git cherrypick --abort




`git merge origin/branchname`


`git reset --soft HEAD~2`





### How to pull changes from upsteam to local 

1. Either push your code or do `git stash`
2. `change branch to dev`
3. `git merge upstream/dev`
