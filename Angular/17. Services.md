In Angular, a **service** is a TypeScript class that can hold logic and data that you want to share across different components. 

1. **Generate a Service:**

   ```bash
   ng generate service my-service
   ```

2. **Define the Service:**

   Open the newly created `my-service.service.ts` file. It should look something like this:

   ```typescript
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root'  // This means the service is available throughout the app
   })
   export class MyServiceService {

     constructor() { }

     getData() {
       return 'Hello from the service!';
     }
   }
   ```

   - `@Injectable`: This decorator tells Angular that the class can be injected as a dependency.
   - `providedIn: 'root'`: This makes the service a singleton, meaning there will only be one instance of it in the application.

### Using the Service in a Component

1. **Inject the Service:**

   Open a component file, e.g., `app.component.ts`, and inject the service into the component:

   ```typescript
   import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
   import { MyServiceService } from './my-service.service';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-root',
     templateUrl: './app.component.html',
     styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
   })
   export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
     data: string;

     constructor(private myService: MyServiceService) { }

     ngOnInit() {
       this.data = this.myService.getData();
     }
   }
   ```

   - `constructor(private myService: MyServiceService)`: This injects the service into the component.
   - `ngOnInit()`: This lifecycle hook is where you typically fetch data or initialize things.

2. **Use the Service in the Template:**

   In `app.component.html`, you can display the data:

   ```html
   <h1>{{ data }}</h1>
   ```


- **Services** are classes that can be used to share logic and data across components.
- **Generate** a service using Angular CLI with `ng generate service`.
- **Inject** the service into your component using dependency injection.
- **Use** the service methods to get or manage data within your component.

#### Other way is to mention in component level

We can mention component inside in app.com.ts without @injectable declarative
