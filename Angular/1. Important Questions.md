### What is Angular
- open-source web application framework developed by Google.
- used for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs)
- where the user interacts with a web page that dynamically updates without reloading the entire page.


### History of Angular

### 1. **AngularJS (2010)**
- **Release**: In 2010, **AngularJS** by Google
- It was created by **Misko Hevery** and **Adam Abrons** to simplify the process of building dynamic web applications
- DisAdvantage - 


### 2. **Angular 2 (2016)**
- **Complete Rewrite**: In 2014, it was announced. Angular 2 was not backward-compatible with AngularJS
- Shift to TypeScript
- Component-based Architecture
- Performance Improvements

## 3. **Angular 4 (2017)**

### 4. **Angular 5 (2017)**

### 5. **Angular 6 (2018)**

### 6. **Angular 7 (2018)**

### 7. **Angular 8 (2019)**

### 8. **Angular 9 (2020)**

### 8. **Angular 9 (2020)**

### 15. **Angular 16 (2023)**


### What is angular.json
- `angular.json` file is a key configuration file in an Angular
- It defines the workspace configuration for Angular CLI, including settings for building, testing, and serving Angular applications


### What is component?
- It controls a section of the user interface (UI) and consists of three main parts: an HTML template, a CSS stylesheet, and a TypeScript class that defines the logic

- **Data Binding**:
    - **Interpolation** (`{{ expression }}`): Used to bind data from the component class to the template. In the example, `{{ title }}` binds the `title` property to the HTML view.
    - **Property Binding** (`[property]="value"`): Binds values to the properties of HTML elements.
    - **Event Binding** (`(event)="handler()"`): Binds events like click, change, or keypress from the template to methods in the component class.
- **Component Communication**:
    - Components can communicate with each other through **inputs** (passing data to child components) and **outputs** (emitting events to parent components).
- **Lifecycle Hooks**:
    - Components have a lifecycle with several hooks that can be tapped into to control behavior, such as `ngOnInit()`, `ngOnChanges()`, and `ngOnDestroy()`.

#### Angular
- Framework
- Language used - Typescript
- For making Single page application and web app development
- Declarative and component based

#### JavaScript
- It is language
- purpose - general purpose scripting
- For making backend, frontend, scripting

- Language - Typescript/ Javascript
- UI library for building components
- Declarative, component based
- One-way data binding
- External library for state management - Redux
- External library for Routing(react-router)
- Virtual DOM for efficient updates

## Lifecycle Hooks

In Angular, lifecycle hooks are special methods that allow developers to tap into the lifecycle of a component or directive. They provide a way to run code at specific points during the component’s lifecycle, such as when it’s created, updated, or destroyed. Here's a summary of the key lifecycle hooks available in Angular:

| **Lifecycle Hook**          | **Description**                                                                                         | **When It's Called**                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ngOnChanges`**           | Called when an input property of the component changes.                                                 | Before `ngOnInit`, and whenever the input properties change.                |
| **`ngOnInit`**              | Called once the component is initialized.                                                               | After the first `ngOnChanges` call and once the component is set up.        |
| **`ngDoCheck`**             | Called during every change detection run, allowing for custom change detection logic.                   | After `ngOnChanges` and `ngOnInit`, and during each change detection cycle. |
| **`ngAfterContentInit`**    | Called after Angular projects content into the component’s view (i.e., after `ngContent` is processed). | Once after the first `ngDoCheck` call.                                      |
| **`ngAfterContentChecked`** | Called after every check of the component’s content (i.e., after the projected content is checked).     | After `ngAfterContentInit` and during each change detection cycle.          |
| **`ngAfterViewInit`**       | Called after the component’s view (and child views) has been initialized.                               | Once after `ngAfterContentChecked`.                                         |
| **`ngAfterViewChecked`**    | Called after every check of the component’s view (and child views).                                     | After `ngAfterViewInit` and during each change detection cycle.             |
| **`ngOnDestroy`**           | Called just before the component is destroyed.                                                          | Right before the component is removed from the DOM.                         |

### Summary of Lifecycle Hooks:

1. **`ngOnChanges`**:
   - **Purpose**: Respond to changes in input properties.
   - **Usage**: Useful for reacting to input property changes and performing actions based on the new input values.

2. **`ngOnInit`**:
   - **Purpose**: Initialize component properties and perform setup logic.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for fetching data or performing initialization tasks that should occur once when the component is created.

3. **`ngDoCheck`**:
   - **Purpose**: Implement custom change detection.
   - **Usage**: Allows developers to manually check and respond to changes that Angular’s default change detection might not catch.

4. **`ngAfterContentInit`**:
   - **Purpose**: Respond to content being projected into the component.
   - **Usage**: Useful when the component needs to perform actions after the content has been inserted into the view.

5. **`ngAfterContentChecked`**:
   - **Purpose**: Respond after Angular checks projected content.
   - **Usage**: Allows for additional logic or updates after the content has been checked.

6. **`ngAfterViewInit`**:
   - **Purpose**: Respond to the component’s view and its child views being initialized.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for operations that depend on the view being fully rendered, such as manipulating DOM elements.

7. **`ngAfterViewChecked`**:
   - **Purpose**: Respond after Angular checks the component’s view and its child views.
   - **Usage**: Useful for performing tasks that need to occur after every view update.

8. **`ngOnDestroy`**:
   - **Purpose**: Cleanup before the component is destroyed.
   - **Usage**: Ideal for unsubscribing from observables, releasing resources, or performing other cleanup tasks to avoid memory leaks.

### Example Usage:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./example.component.css']
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy, AfterViewInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    console.log('ngOnChanges:', changes);
  }

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('ngOnInit: Component initialized');
  }

  ngDoCheck() {
    console.log('ngDoCheck: Custom change detection');
  }

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    console.log('ngAfterContentInit: Content projected');
  }

  ngAfterContentChecked() {
    console.log('ngAfterContentChecked: Content checked');
  }

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    console.log('ngAfterViewInit: View initialized');
  }

  ngAfterViewChecked() {
    console.log('ngAfterViewChecked: View checked');
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('ngOnDestroy: Component is about to be destroyed');
  }
}
```

Each lifecycle hook serves a specific purpose and provides developers with the ability to manage different stages of a component’s life, allowing for fine-grained control and efficient resource management.


### Why is port 4200?
- Port `4200` is the default for Angular applications
- You can easily change the port using the `--port` option with `ng serve` or by configuring `angular.json`


### Difference between Javascript and Typescript

Here's a concise comparison between TypeScript and JavaScript, especially focusing on the `strict = true` setting in TypeScript:

| **Feature**         | **JavaScript**                                | **TypeScript**                                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**        | Dynamic, loosely typed                        | Superset of JavaScript, statically typed                      |
| **Type Checking**   | Runtime type checking                         | Compile-time type checking with `strict = true`               |
| **Strict Mode**     | No built-in strict mode                       | `strict = true` enforces stricter type checks                 |
| **Error Detection** | Errors often only detected at runtime         | Many errors caught at compile-time with `strict`              |
| **Code Quality**    | Less enforced; manual checks needed           | Enhanced through type annotations and checks                  |
| **Features**        | Basic syntax and features of JavaScript       | Advanced features like interfaces, generics, and type aliases |
| **Tooling**         | Limited to runtime checks and debugging tools | Richer tooling and editor support with type information       |
| **Example**         | `let num = 'string';`                         | `let num: number = 'string';` (Type error)                    |

### Summary:
- **JavaScript**: Loosely typed and checks types at runtime.
- **TypeScript**: Statically typed with strict mode (`strict = true`) providing compile-time type checking for better code quality and early error detection.


### what is single page application and multipage application

- **SPA**: Provides a smoother and faster experience by dynamically updating content without reloading the page. Examples include Google Maps and Gmail.
- **MPA**: Uses separate HTML pages for different sections, with full page reloads for navigation. Examples include e-commerce sites and traditional corporate websites.



### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs. Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

- **SSR**:
  - **Definition**: Renders HTML on the server before sending it to the client.
  - **Advantages**: Faster initial load, better SEO.
  - **Example**: Traditional websites like news sites.

- **CSR**:
  - **Definition**: Renders HTML dynamically in the browser using JavaScript.
  - **Advantages**: Smooth interactions, dynamic updates.
  - **Example**: Single Page Applications (SPAs) like Gmail and Google Maps.
