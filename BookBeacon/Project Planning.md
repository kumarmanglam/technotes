Project Planning

for a not premium book any member can use that book
for a premium book , tell concurrency - 2 ,--- only two user can read at same time..... 

Bundle - list of books ---- 

Manage the concurrency --- 

Basic Design + basic excel we will get.....

Excel 
`B1 book1 id1 premium`
`B1 book2 id2 normal`


search for bundle
for premium books one dialog opens 
tell how many premium you have - 
then link to books details 

third ------ Bulk edit

license is using a bundle


concurrency is N/A formal books
concurrency same
concurrency --- if different - title specify

two options --- 
if we create a bundle -- with EBS mode --- then do not include premium books 
--then no concurrency


one bundle can have multiple license

multiple license can be created on one license



## Clarification

- Can one book be common in multiple bundles
