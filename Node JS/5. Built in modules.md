Built-in modules in Node.js, often referred to as core modules, ==are modules that come bundled with Node.js ==and can be used without the need for additional installation. Here's a brief overview of some core modules:

## 1. **Path Module:**
   - **Purpose:** Provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
   - **Import:**
     ```javascript
     const path = require('path');
     ```

## 2. **Events Module:**
   - **Purpose:** Implements the EventEmitter class, allowing the creation and handling of custom events.
   - **Import:**
     ```javascript
     const EventEmitter = require('events');
     ```

## 3. **File System (fs) Module:**
   - **Purpose:** Enables interaction with the file system, allowing reading, writing, and manipulation of files and directories.
   - **Import:**
     ```javascript
     const fs = require('fs');
     ```

## 4. **Stream Module:**
   - **Purpose:** Provides a foundation for building applications that require streaming data, allowing efficient processing of large datasets.
   - **Import:**
     ```javascript
     const stream = require('stream');
     ```

## 5. **HTTP Module:**
   - **Purpose:** Facilitates the creation of HTTP servers and clients, allowing the development of web applications.
   - **Import:**
     ```javascript
     const http = require('http');
     ```

### Usage Example:
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const fs = require('fs');
const stream = require('stream');
const http = require('http');

// Example usage of the core modules
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'example.txt');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
const fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello, Node.js!');
});

// Further usage and interactions with these modules can be implemented based on specific needs.
```

These core modules offer fundamental functionality for various tasks in Node.js applications, and they can be extensively used to build a wide range of applications, from file manipulation to creating web servers.
