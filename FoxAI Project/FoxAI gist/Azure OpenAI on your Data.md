## What is Azure OpenAI On Your Data

You can access Azure OpenAI On Your Data using a REST API, via the SDK or the web-based interface in theÂ [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/). You can also create a web app that connects to your data to enable an enhanced chat solution or deploy it directly as a copilot in the Copilot Studio (preview).
